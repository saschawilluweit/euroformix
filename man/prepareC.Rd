\usage{
prepareC(nC, samples, popFreq, refData = NULL, condOrder = NULL,
  knownRef = NULL, kit = NULL, knownRel = NULL, ibd = c(1, 0, 0),
  fst = 0, incS = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nC}{Number of contributors in model.}

\item{samples}{A List with samples which for each samples has locus-list elements with list elements adata and hdata. 'adata' is a qualitative (allele) data vector and 'hdata' is a quantitative (peak heights) data vector.}

\item{popFreq}{A list of allele frequencies for a given population.}

\item{refData}{Reference objects with list element [[s]][[i]]. The list element has reference-list with list-element 's' having a loci-list adata with list-element 'i storing qualitative data.}

\item{condOrder}{Specify conditioning references from refData (must be consistent order). For instance condOrder=(0,2,1,0) means that we restrict the model such that Ref2 and Ref3 are respectively conditioned as 2. contributor and 1. contributor in the model.}

\item{knownRef}{Specify known non-contributing references from refData (indices). For instance knownRef=(1,2) means that reference 1 and 2 is known non-contributor in the hypothesis. This affectes coancestry correction.}

\item{kit}{shortname of kit: {"ESX17","ESI17","ESI17Fast","ESX17Fast","Y23","Identifiler","NGM","ESSPlex","ESSplexSE","NGMSElect","SGMPlus","ESX16", "Fusion","GlobalFiler","ForenSeq"}}

\item{knownRel}{Specify the index of the related contributing reference from refData (one index). For instance knownRel=2 means that unknown1 is related to reference 2 with ibd specified relationship.}

\item{ibd}{the identical by decent coefficients of the relationship (specifies the type of relationship)}

\item{fst}{The co-ancestry coefficient. Default is 0.}

\item{incS}{A boolean whether to include potential stutters to the allele outcome. Default is FALSE.}
