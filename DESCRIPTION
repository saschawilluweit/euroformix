Description: euroformix contains procedures for maximization, integration and MCMC of likelihoods of a continuous model for replicated STR DNA mixtures for a general specifications of hypotheses. It also does deconvolution condition on the continuous model. The continuous model takes care of drop-out, drop-in, stutters and degradation.
